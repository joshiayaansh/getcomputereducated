# What is a CPU?
### Most of us know there lies a CPU in our PC, but what really is it?
A CPU is basically just a really powerful calculator, and the most powerful ones have ranged up so powerful it could run a supercomputer.
## But what is it?
A CPU calculates bits as `0` or `1` rather any numbers. These bits are derived from `machine code`, which is in any normal `executable`, such as Google Chrome.
## How do they work?
CPUs work by translating all of the `machine code` into bits that it can understand.
> ðŸ’¡ Hint: A program goes through: C# -> Assembly -> Linker -> Machine Code
## Now that you know all about CPUs, It's time to delve into the world of computers.
